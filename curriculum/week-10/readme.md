This is a summary of the materials provided for Week 10 of the Data Science Immersive.

> **Instructors: Please note that this week requires additional preparations.**

> You will want to familiarize yourself with them and budget for time to complete / review the following installation & signup details with students before teaching this week's materials.

> 1. Students will need to install a custom VM to run introductory materials. [See instructions here](https://github.com/ga-students/DSI_SM_01/blob/master/curriculum/week-09/VM-big-data-setup.md).

> 2. Instructors will need to send students individual URLs for them to sign up/access their AWS credits. [See instructions here](https://github.com/ga-students/DSI_SM_01/blob/master/curriculum/week-09/VM-big-data-setup.md).
